nextflow.py is a Python wrapper around the Nextflow pipeline framework. It lets
you run Nextflow pipelines from Python code.

Example
-------

   >>> import nextflow
   >>> execution = nextflow.run(path="main.nf", params={"param1": "123"})
   >>> print(execution.status)


Installing
----------

pip
~~~

nextflow.py can be installed using pip::

    $ pip install nextflow

If you get permission errors, try using ``sudo``::

    $ sudo pip install nextflow


Development
~~~~~~~~~~~

The repository for nextflow.py, containing the most recent iteration, can be
found `here <http://github.com/goodwright/nextflow.py/>`_. To clone the
nextflow.py repository directly from there, use::

    $ git clone git://github.com/goodwright/nextflow.py.git


Nextflow
~~~~~~~~

nextflow.py requires the Nextflow executable to be installed and in your PATH.
Instructions for installing Nextflow can be found at
`their website <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation/>`_.


Testing
~~~~~~~

To test a local version of nextflow.py, cd to the nextflow.py directory and run::

    $ python -m unittest discover tests

You can opt to only run unit tests or integration tests::

    $ python -m unittest discover tests.unit
    $ python -m unittest discover tests.integration



Overview
--------

The starting point for any nextflow.py pipeline is the ``Pipeline``
object. This is initialised with a path to the file in question, and,
optionally, the location of an accompanying config file:

    >>> pipeline1 = nextflow.Pipeline("pipelines/my-pipeline.nf")
    >>> pipeline2 = nextflow.Pipeline("main.nf", config="nextflow.config")

Running
~~~~~~~

To actually execute the pipeline, the ``run`` method is used:

    >>> execution = pipeline.run()

This will return an ``Execution`` object, which represents the pipeline
execution that just took place. You can customise the execution with various
options:

    >>> execution = pipeline.run(location="./rundir", params={"param1": "123"}, profile=["docker", "test"], version="22.0.1")

This sets the execution to take place in a different location, passes
``--param1=123`` as a command line argument when the pipeline is run, uses the
Nextflow profiles 'docker' and 'test', and runs with Nextflow version 22.0.1
(regardless of what version of Nextflow is installed).

Executions
##########

An ``Execution`` represents a single execution of a
``Pipeline``. It has properties for:

* ``id`` - The unique ID of that run, generated by Nextflow.

* ``started`` - When the pipeline ran (as a UNIX timestamp).

* ``started_dt`` - When the pipeline ran (as a Python datetime).

* ``duration`` - how long the execution took in seconds.

* ``status`` - the status Nextflow reports on completion.

* ``command`` - the command used to run the pipeline.

* ``stdout`` - the stdout of the execution process.

* ``stderr`` - the stderr of the execution process.

* ``log`` - the full text of the log file produced.

* ``returncode`` - the exit code of the run - usually 0 or 1.

It also has a ``process_executions`` property, which is a list of
``ProcessExecution`` objects. Nextflow processes data by chaining
together isolated 'processes', and each of these has a
``ProcessExecution`` object representing its execution. These have the
following properties:

* ``hash`` - The unique ID generated by Nextflow, of the form ``xx/xxxxxx``.

* ``process`` - The name of the process that spawned the process execution.

* ``name`` - The name of this specific process execution.

* ``status`` - the status Nextflow reports on completion.

* ``stdout`` - the stdout of the process execution.

* ``stderr`` - the stderr of the process execution.

* ``started`` - When the process execution ran (as a UNIX timestamp).

* ``started_dt`` - When the process execution ran (as a Python datetime).

* ``duration`` - how long the process execution took in seconds.

* ``returncode`` - the exit code of the process execution - usually 0 or 1.

Polling
~~~~~~~

The method described above will run the pipeline and wait while it does, with
the completed ``Execution`` being returned only at the end.

An alternate method is to use ``run_and_poll``, which returns an
``Execution`` object every few seconds representing the state of the
pipeline execution at that moment in time, as a generator::

    for execution in pipeline.run_and_poll(sleep=2, location="./rundir", params={"param1": "123"}, profile=["docker", "test"], version="22.0.1"):
        print("Processing intermediate execution")

By default, an ``Execution`` will be returned every 5 seconds, but you
can adjust this as required with the ``sleep`` paramater. This is useful if you
want to get information about the progress of the pipeline execution as it
proceeds.

Direct Running
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you just want to run a single pipeline without initialising a
``Pipeline`` object first, you can ``run`` or
``run_and_poll`` directly, without needing to create a
``Pipeline``:

    >>> import nextflow
    >>> execution = nextflow.run(path="pipeline.nf", config="settings.config", params={"param1": "123"})
